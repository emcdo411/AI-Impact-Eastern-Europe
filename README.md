## **Code**  

Below is the R code used to generate the interactive maps and 3D plot:

### **2D Interactive Map: AI Adoption by Sector**

```r
# Load required libraries
library(leaflet)

# Create a data frame with countries and the sectors benefiting most from AI
data <- data.frame(
  country = c("Hungary", "Czech Republic", "Croatia"),
  lat = c(47.1625, 50.0755, 45.1),
  lng = c(19.5033, 14.4378, 15.2),
  sector = c("Manufacturing", "Healthcare", "Automotive"),
  ai_tool = c("Uptake", "Zebra Medical Vision", "Waymo"),
  productivity_increase = c(30, 20, 15)
)

# Create the interactive map
map <- leaflet(data) %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    radius = 10,
